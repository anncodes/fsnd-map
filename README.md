# Reflections
The project was very challenging.  I got stuck after I was able to siplay the map and the markers. The biggest hurdle was using knockout.js.  The biggest help was going back to Lesson 4- Refactoring with Separation of Concerns.  Instead of jumping here and there.  I was able to organise and structure the code.  <br>
Checking the console on DevTools of my browser was very helpful to deal and solve each error.
